This includes a new Support frame, the DENALI, as well as heavy and auxiliary weapons for types that yet to exist, additional new main weapons for increased versatility, a new Superheavy launcher and melee weapon, a new grenade and mine, tech, and shield system for those burgeoning young controllers and supports.","website":"https://esbionarshadow.itch.io/gms-crisis-catalogue"}
