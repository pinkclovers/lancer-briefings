Flight movement must follow a straight line; however, if a character takes additional movement actions, such as BOOST, these can be used to move in a different direction. <br><br>Flying characters have IMMUNITY to PRONE. Flying characters begin falling if they become IMMOBILIZED, STUNNED, or otherwise can’t move. Flying characters that take structure damage or stress must succeed on an AGILITY save or begin falling. <br><br>Some advanced mechs can HOVER. HOVER is an advanced form of FLIGHT.

On a success, they clear all burn currently marked; otherwise, they take BURN damage equal to the amount of burn currently marked.<br><br>Failing the ENGINEERING check does not increase how much burn is marked, it just prevents the currently marked burn from being cleared. Also, if a character is hit by multiple sources of BURN, the character still only makes one ENGINEERING check."
