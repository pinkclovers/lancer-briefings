    "description": "An unusually large proportion of this planet’s animal or plant life is dangerous; some of the flora and fauna may predatory, particularly hostile, or even titanic in size. Use the Monstrosity NPC type to generate encounters with wildlife. Hostile flora can appear on the battlefield as immobile characters with Size 1–2, 5 HP, and Evasion 10; targets that move adjacent to them must succeed on a Hull save or take 3 Kinetic Damage and become Immobilized until the flora is destroyed, as it traps them with sticky sap, webbing, a pit, or the like."

Mechs that don’t move or Boost on their turn become Immobilized at the end of their turn. This lasts until they break free with a successful Hull save as a quick action. In addition, all mechs gain Resistance to Heat."

Outside of mechs, humans without environmental protection temporarily decrease their maximum HP by 1 per hour of exposure. If they reach 0 HP this way, they die.

    "description": "Instead of a surface, this world is comprised of countless floating islands or spires, each held aloft in a gaseous substrate and suspended through magnetic force. Perhaps the crust was shattered by a superweapon or natural disaster. Most of the remaining landmass is disconnected, although some islands are large enough to hold cities. Navigation systems are almost useless here."
