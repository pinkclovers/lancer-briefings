T-2 charged melee weapons are structurally similar to GMS’s T-1 melee weapons, though built with different materials to tolerate the intense heat generated by their projected plasma sheaths. These sheaths can be toggled on or off, depending on the needs of the pilot. GMS’s T-2 energy weapons, like their T-1 kinetics, are sturdy tools with predictable power scaling, minimal particle scattering, and consistent performance ranges. They feature universal ports allowing them to accept a variety of power sources, from hardline cabling through to “magazine” style power packs.","customDamageType":null,"maxUseOverride":0,"uses":0,"selectedProfile":0}}],"extra":[],"bonus_effects":[],"modifiable":true},{"mount_type":"Flex","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Flex","weapon":{"id":"mw_missile_rack","destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"loaded":true,"mod":null,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Much like GMS mechs, GMS weapons are reliable galactic standards, made using interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions.
