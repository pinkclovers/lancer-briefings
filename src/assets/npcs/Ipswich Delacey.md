*“What’s up lancers, it’s ya boi Switch, back at it again Live from the Long Rim!”*

Short, thin, with white-platinum hair. Ipswich is loud and extroverted. They showed up a few years ago promptly taking up the career of 'lifestyle Omninet streamer'. Their stream 'Live from the Long Rim' and its related memes have grown to be somewhat of a staple in omninet culture.


The fact they're often streaming live footage of the station's inner working and day-to-day activity is a minor security issue for Jerry. Likely he would've shut the whole thing down if Ipswich wasn't funneling half of their donations to the station's discretionary budget.


As well, they are a public point of contact for the Horizon Collective, for those interested.
