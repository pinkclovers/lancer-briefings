*“C’mon, kiddos! Outnumbered two-to-one just means they have half as much chance of killing you!”*

Tall and heavyset with dreadlocks pulled into a ponytail, DeJean is the Militia Commander.
Although physically imposing they have a boistorous attitude with a crude but good-natured sense of humor and a whimsical outlook on life.
