*"Well, that’s a fascinating question! I’m so glad you asked" [you did not ask]*

Striga is a tall, rail-thin, ghostly pale woman. Recognizable by her squirrely demeanor, wild hair and unnaturally wide eyes.

She is the eccentric and paranoid leader of a tight clique of similarly dispositioned sigdivers known as "The Truth".  Despite the quirks she and her crew are the stations best source for obscure data, esoteric software and information retrieval. 

But if you want her services you're going to have to earn her trust first.
