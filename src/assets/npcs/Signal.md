The cocky sigdiver operating not to far away from Hell's Gate in the orbit of Stygia. Was brutally shot to death by the **POET**.
He was looking into something on behalf of "DRIVETRAIN," another HORUS member. Starting about 6 years ago, he was looking for a small-scale spatiotemporal anomaly. You interrupted him before he was able to send one of his finding to Andros Capella.
