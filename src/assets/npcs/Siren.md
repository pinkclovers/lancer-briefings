**“No whining, marine! Think of g-force like a high score! Are you gonna let Mother Nature beat you?!”**


An **ALKONOST**-class flight operations NHP who's lived since SecComm. During an absence of qualified pilots after the Demon Winter, Siren was given flight control of the *Dragon's Tooth*, one of the Gate's clippers.

She has cultivated a stern, bellicose attitude of a drill sergeant from her previous life, something she's been trying to mediate as she adapts to civilian life, and now resurfacing as she ferry's y'all.
Out of habit, she calls you "marines" no matter how many times you ask her to stop.

Her casket has eleven tally marks on its casing, but she doesn’t remember what they mean. Clipped to it is a folder containing emergency protocols in the event of a cascade, and an ad-hoc Balwinder-Bolaño schedule.
She’s just about to come off a cycle, and should be stable for the next six years, barring unexpected cascade triggers.
