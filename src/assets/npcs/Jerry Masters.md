*"Anxiety attack? No, this feels more like an anxiety war of attrition."*

A pale, short and twitchy ball of anxiety and insomnia; constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown.


He was part of the Gate's spec-ops team, when Bai Zexian, the previous station director vanished, Jerry was the only one who stepped up to the roll.
