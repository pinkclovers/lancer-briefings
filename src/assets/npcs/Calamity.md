*"Trust me, kid, lotta people have that idea once, and the ones who survive never try it again."*

Perhaps the station's most controversial residents. She is a constant reminder of the time Jerry has broken the Golden Rule of Hell's Gate, Never let a Hell Hound back on the station.


She was one of the Hound's very worst, until she became so popular in the ranks that Capella saw her as a threat. What followed was the inevitable fate of any Hound who displeases him: her mech was sabotaged and a “tragic accident” was arranged. But through some miracle, she survived long enough to be picked up by one of the Gate’s salvage crews.


Jerry's reasoning for allowing her to stay, is simply because it is more dangerous for her not to be under the watch of Hell's Gate.
