*“Man walks into a grocery store, asks for a can of beans.*

*"Guy at the counter says ‘hey, didn’t I sell you a can of beans twenty minutes ago?’*

*“Man says ‘yeah, but it got all dented.’*

*“Guy at the counter asks ‘how’d it get dented?’*

*"Man says ‘well, I was cavin’ in some bugger’s skull with it.’*

*“Guy at the counter asks ‘why the hell were you cavin’ in a guy’s skull with a can of beans?!’*

*“Man says ‘well, what was I supposed to do when he wouldn’t give me his can opener?’*

*“So, guy at the counter says ‘can’t you just eat the beans outta the dented can?’*

*“Man says ‘mate, do I look like a savage to you?’”*
