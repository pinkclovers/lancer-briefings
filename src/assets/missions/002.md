## WORKING HOLIDAY

Bright light city
Gonna set my soul
Gonna set my soul on fire


– Elvis Presley,
“Viva Las Vegas”

# Goals

- Ensure the security of the Icebreaker Borealis, and end any potential threats to its stability.

# Stakes

- If the Icebreaker Borealis is unoperable, the system's main source of external revenue will be gone. More immediately, your best customer will be gone.

# Reserves

- You can bring anything from the previous mission with you, Rita might be willing to expense a few additional supplies throughout the mission.

# Rewards
- Rita has the resources and contacts for you to advance to LL2, possibly allowing you to get your hands on a new frame.
