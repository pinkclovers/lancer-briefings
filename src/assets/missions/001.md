## The Drop

# Briefing
As of 1400 hours, we are on combat alert. Several hours ago we received a transmission from Ambassador Bannerjee that civil defnse warning were being sounded across Nov Elysia.
Cressidium is not officially a member of Union at this point. Militarily, we aren't authorized to intervene on behalf of the LSA in this conflict, but simply leaving Captain Ferris and Ambassador Bannerjee to ride this out is NOT an option.

# Goals

- Make your way through Nov Elysia to reach FOB Saber

# Stakes

- Failure to rendezvous at FOB Saber in a timely fashion will result in delays, setting the operation's timetable back and potentially narrowing the window of opportunity to rescue Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.

# Reserves

- None at this time.

# Rewards
- Upon arrival at FOB Saber, the situation on the ground will be evaluated and field upgrades distributed accordingly.
- At his discretion, 1st Lt. Kim may also authorize the distribution of advanced weapons and systems.
