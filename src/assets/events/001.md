The squad is en-route to a wreckage of a Harrison Armory capital ship, in hopes of locating a Delta-5 Power Cell, I'm here to get live footage from the frontlines of our brave militia crew.

**POET** experienced some freaky ass shit in the cargo bay, **ROULETTE** *thinks* he might understand what happened but only time will tell.
**SIREN** and I chilled for most of the ride watching some weird psychological horror show or smthng, would be totally creeped out but **SIREN** kept interrupting it explaining how the show foreshadowed stuff.
Meanwhile **JOE** chilled in the mech bay for most of the ride, jerking off prolly.

Over n' out - Ipswich
