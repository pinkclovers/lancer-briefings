The squad is en-route to a wreckage of a Harrison Armory capital ship, hoping to snag a Delta-5 Power Cell, getting some sicc nasty live footage from the frontlines of our brave militia crew.

Apparently **POET** experienced some freaky ass shit in the cargo bay and **ROULETTE** *thinks* he might understand what happened but hasn't really kept me in the loop.
**SIREN** and I chilled for most of the ride watching some weird psychological horror show or smthng, would be totally creeped out but **SIREN** kept interrupting it explaining how the show foreshadowed stuff.
**JOE** chilled in the mech bay for most of the ride, jerking off prolly.

Over n' out - Ipswich
