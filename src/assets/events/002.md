Myrna: "Fuckin, Haunted Ghost Ship"

**MINT** had a mental breakdown due to impossible internal geometry in one of the rooms, the Tachyon's layout seemed to defy all logic.

**ROULETTE** is glad he did not try the food at the canteen within the ship. That seemed to be both rotted and fresh simultaneously.

**POET** had first-hand experience with the paracausal. Seeing visions of red-hot bird tracks and feathers plastering the walls of the ship.

The *TACHYON* housed a PROMETHEUS-class NHP named "Feather" that seemingly cascaded and broke free, the ship itself dates from 400+ years in the future (April 13th, 5424u), constructed by a group called "FourthComm" ruled by "The Council of Tyrants."

The Ship was designed for war but lacked any weaponry and seemingly was still mid-construction when found. It seemed it's collision with the *IPS-N Ardent Weasel* happened during a unplanned time-blink when the NHP onboard cascaded. Protocols the ship alarms referred to were not marked in any Union documents but similarly named protocols did exist under Harrison Armory.
