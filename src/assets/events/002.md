Myrna: "Fuckin, Haunted Ghost Ship"

**MINT** had a mental breakdown due to impossible internal geometry in one of the rooms, the Tachyon's layout seemed to defy all logic.
**ROULETTE** is glad he did not try the food at the canteen within the ship. That seemed to be both rotted and fresh simultaneously
**POET** had first-hand experience with the paracausal. Seeing visions of red-hot bird tracks and feathers plastering the walls of the ship.
