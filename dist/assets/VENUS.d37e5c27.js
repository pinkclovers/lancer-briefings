Her entire life was spent repairing machinery, especially the vehicles used to traverse the gas giant. However, only once in her career did she ever work on her current obsession: a mechanized chassis, one belonging to a late Lancer. The lancer had once lived in the city and had left to enlist in a Harrison Armory defense contract, though it all happened before Hailey had any real memory of it. Now, as she was still young, the broken chassis had ended up in her family's workshop. Investigating the hulking machine, piecing its components together, reminded her of a beating heart moving blood around a body. </p><p>The "aliveness" of the machine she crawled around in peaked when it spoke to her. As she connected two wires, a voice identical to that of its pilot, and yet it wasn't. It startled her, but it also reassured her. As she continued to fix the dilapidated machinery, the two conversed. &lt;TODO: she wonders where the machine will go after this and (accidentally?) bonds with the NHP inside&gt;</p>`,l=[],ae=6,c="Mechanic",d=[],u=[{id:"681a94b0-9a6e-4a0a-bb66-64b393a53623",name:"Gas-Giant Miracle",notes:"",gm_note:"",frame:"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest",active:!1,current_structure:4,current_move:4,boost:0,current_hp:12,overshield:0,current_stress:4,current_heat:0,current_repairs:5,current_overcharge:0,current_core_energy:1,statuses:[],conditions:[],resistances:[],reactions:[],burn:0,destroyed:!1,defeat:"",activations:1,meltdown_imminent:!1,reactor_destroyed:!1,core_active:!1,cc_ver:"ERR",lastModified:"Tue Jan 02 2024 22:45:06 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)",isDeleted:!1,expireTime:"",deleteTime:"",portrait:"",cloud_portrait:"https://d1nurxym97qk9o.cloudfront.net/public/us-east-1:6de1a95a-cc23-4bb6-bcc7-582b4dd57bc2/mech/image4x(14).webp",loadouts:[{id:"f5249822-bb7f-4b32-9c75-f49a8863ad15",name:"Primary",systems:[{id:"ms_technophile_1",uses:0,destroyed:!1,cascading:!1,flavorName:"",flavorDescription:"<span class='horus--subtle'>[an eager student].</span><br>Gained from the <i>Technophile: Rank I</i> pilot talent."},{id:"ms_personalizations",uses:0,destroyed:!1,cascading:!1,flavorName:"",flavorDescription:""},{id:"ms_pattern_a_jericho_deployable_cover",uses:0,destroyed:!1,cascading:!1,flavorName:"",flavorDescription:""},{id:"ms_custom_paint_job",uses:0,destroyed:!1,cascading:!1,flavorName:"",flavorDescription:""},{id:"ms_rapid_burst_jump_jet_system",uses:0,destroyed:!1,cascading:!1,flavorName:"",flavorDescription:""}],integratedSystems:[],mounts:[{mount_type:"Main",lock:!1,slots:[{size:"Main",weapon:{id:"mw_rocket_propelled_grenade",destroyed:!1,cascading:!1,loaded:!0,mod:null,flavorName:"",flavorDescription:"Much like GMS mechs, GMS weapons are reliable galactic standards, made using interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions.
